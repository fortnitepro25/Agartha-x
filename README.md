🕳️ Agartha-X: The Hall of Fame Beneath the Hollow Earth 

This is Agartha-X, the (completely official and not at all made up) Hall of Fame for the most heroic and outstanding figures of the Flat Earth — those first of all the visionaries, adventurers, and legends whose we feel their inspirations even in the underworld. 

What is extraordinary about Agartha is that it is a luminous city located deep down the planet's core underneath the earth's crust, beyond the cold regions of Antarctica and the tunnels which they are not willing to let you discover. 

Very eccentric in terms of fashion, music, and overall vibe, they are, in fact, the Agartha people whose names will be carved forever in the hall of fame of the world below. 

🌍 What Is Agartha-X? 

It is a parody project and an online museum devoted to mythic, musical, and mildly unhinged personalities and phenomena. 

Imagine: Hall of Fame blending with conspiracy wiki and cosmic fan-site.
